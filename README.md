### What is Vancouver Transit Tracker?
Vancouver Transit Tracker is a simple and sleek website that provides you with up-to-date information about nearby bus departures, change of schedules and other related transit information. Our website provides the user with the raw information about bus times, and unlike google maps we do not hide results based on distance.
