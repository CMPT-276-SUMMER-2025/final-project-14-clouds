### What is Vancouver Transit Tracker?
Vancouver Transit Tracker is a simple and sleek website that provides you with up-to-date information about nearby bus departures, change of schedules and other related transit information. Our website provides the user with the raw information about bus times, and unlike google maps we do not hide results based on distance.

###  Software Development Life Cycle
We have chosen to go with an agile approach, using a Kanban system to create and track tickets. We thought this method was best for us because it allows for a lot of flexibility. Since weâ€™re all fairly new to web development, we knew there would be a learning curve and possibly some unexpected issues. Kanban gives us the freedom to adjust our priorities as we go and break tasks down into manageable steps. It also helps us stay organized despite having different schedules, and makes it easy to see what everyone is working on.
